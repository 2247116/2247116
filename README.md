Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Taylor. This repositiory will contain personal projects as I complete them. 

I am currenlty working on an extension on my masters project - Expanding it to : 
      - Semi autonomus - Fix up the Synth-data such that it does not need constraints 
      - Make it replicable - saving all models when created
      - Enusre the tests sets do not include Synth data 
      - Save results to file
      
This also includes refactoring the majoirty of code to refelct the changes hilighted above


I've also gota few personla projects that I am going to uploading to here. 
The first being an analysis on a covid dataset - However this produced relativley poor results given the dataset used (lack of features).
