Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Taylor. This repositiory will contain personal projects as I complete them. 

I am currenlty working on an extension on my masters project - Expanding it to : 
      - Semi autonomus - Fix up the Synth-data such that it does not need constraints 
      - Make it replicable - saving all models when created
      - Enusre the tests sets do not include Synth data 
      - Save results to file
      
 These changes should make the reuslts of the project irreproacable and allow for a much larger test set.
